# Minimalistic-Storefront

- This is an online shopping mini-store. It is a multiple page application comprising of the Product Listing page, the Product Description page, the Mini-cart overlay, and the official Cart Page. Users can optionally add a product to their shopping cart from either the PLP, or the PDP. Default attributes are provided incase a user chooses to add a product to the cart directly without a preffered selection of it's available options.
- A currency switcher is also provided to allow a user to view an item's price at their preferred currency. Amazingly, users can also view the total cost of all cart items at the same preffered currency.
- Additionally, users can filter the displayed products by category using the different links on the navbar.
